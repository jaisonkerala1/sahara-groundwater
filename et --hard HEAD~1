[33made3cbb[m[33m ([m[1;36mHEAD[m[33m -> [m[1;32mmain[m[33m, [m[1;31morigin/main[m[33m)[m fix: restore haptic feedback with debugging and test button - increase vibration intensity: 15ms  100ms, 10ms  50ms - add console logging for haptic feedback debugging - add test vibration button for testing haptic support - make success vibration more noticeable: [30,20,30]  [100,50,100] - add debug logs to track haptic feedback execution - test button triggers [200,100,200] pattern for clear testing
[33md8418a2[m fix: implement aggressive haptic feedback stopping mechanism - add hapticIntervalRef for reliable interval tracking - implement forceStopHaptic function for emergency cleanup - add navigator.vibrate(0) to force stop ongoing vibrations - add haptic timeout (30s) to prevent infinite vibration - use forceStopHaptic for error cases and catch blocks - clear haptic timeout in finally block - ensure haptic stops on both success and error scenarios
[33m9732821[m fix: make haptic feedback much gentler and stop instantly - reduce vibration intensity: 50ms  15ms, 30ms  10ms - make success vibration gentler: [100,50,100]  [30,20,30] - increase pulse interval: 2s  3s for less frequent feedback - stop haptic feedback immediately when analysis completes - stop haptic feedback immediately on quota limit/errors - ensure instant cleanup with proper interval clearing
[33m84d2ed2[m fix: ensure haptic feedback stops in all analysis scenarios - stop haptic feedback when daily quota limit is reached - stop haptic feedback on analysis failure/errors - stop haptic feedback on network errors and timeouts - remove duplicate haptic feedback stop calls - ensure proper cleanup in all analysis completion paths
[33m59daddf[m feat: add ChatGPT-like haptic feedback (vibration) during analysis - add triggerHaptic function with navigator.vibrate support - implement startHapticFeedback with gentle initial vibration and 2s pulses - add stopHapticFeedback with success vibration pattern - integrate haptic feedback into handleAnalyze function - add cleanup on component unmount to prevent memory leaks - support mobile devices with vibration API - graceful fallback for non-vibration devices
