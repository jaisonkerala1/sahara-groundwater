# ðŸš€ Deploy Email Fix to Live Website

## The Problem
The live website (report.saharagroundwater.com) is still showing `contact@saharagroundwater.com` because it's using old build files from Hostinger server.

## The Solution
You need to upload the updated build files to your Hostinger server.

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Build the Updated App (Already Done âœ…)
```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

### 2. Upload to Hostinger
1. **Go to Hostinger File Manager**
2. **Navigate to your subdomain directory** (`report.saharagroundwater.com`)
3. **Delete the old `build/` folder** (or rename it to `build_old/` as backup)
4. **Upload the new `client/build/` folder** from your local machine
5. **Make sure the structure is:**
   ```
   report.saharagroundwater.com/
   â”œâ”€â”€ server.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
   â”œâ”€â”€ .env
   â””â”€â”€ build/ (NEW - with updated email)
       â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
       â”œâ”€â”€ static/
       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ css/
       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ js/
       â””â”€â”€ sw.js (updated cache version)
   ```

### 3. Clear Server Cache
1. **Restart your Node.js application** in Hostinger
2. **Clear any CDN cache** if you're using one

### 4. Test
Visit `https://report.saharagroundwater.com` and check the footer - it should now show "example" instead of "contact@saharagroundwater.com"

## Files to Upload
- Upload the entire contents of `client/build/` folder
- The key file is `client/build/static/js/main.cad86e2b.js` which contains the updated email

## Alternative: Quick Fix
If you want to change it to a proper email instead of "example", let me know and I can update it to the final email address before you deploy.
